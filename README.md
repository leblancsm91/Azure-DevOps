I gained a great amount of experience working on a team of other developers on a project. Being apart of a team was a large step from working by myself on coding projects. I learned different methods of communicating with my teammates, and how to work with someone else as a two-person team on a single small project. I learned this while I worked with a developer as a two-person team on changing the side-navigation on webpage. The original code was messy, which left us communicating in Slack. We used Visual Studio Live to work on this change.
